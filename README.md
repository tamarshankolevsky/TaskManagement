## Description
 
 * [To desciption of the project follow this link](https://github.com/AnnaKarpf/Full-stack-web-development_4578-2/blob/master/12_Web%20api/final%20project.docx)

## Development server
To install the app in your computer you have to:
  1. [Run the `mySql` code](https://github.com/tamarshankolevsky/TaskManagement/tree/master/SQL)
      To see some data in the live demo, you should add data to your tabels or
      [Run the data- script code](https://github.com/tamarshankolevsky/TaskManagement/tree/master/SQL)

  2. Run the `back-end` project.(the web api one)  This is the server. Navigate to `http://localhost:53728/`. 

  3.  Run the `php` server by 
        ```sh 
        shift+f6
        ```
        on the index.php page

  4.  Run `ng serve` for a dev server, if you want to run the angular project. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. 
      The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
      choose which server you want to: the web api or the php one. 

  5. Run the win form project, if you want it to be the client.
  
        *important note: in order to `send email` feature  from the php server(just if you have xampp) in your computer follow this instruction:* 
        
        in php.ini file find [mail function] and change
        ```sh
        SMTP=smtp.gmail.com
        smtp_port=587
        sendmail_from = my-gmail-id@gmail.com
        sendmail_path = "\"C:\xampp\sendmail\sendmail.exe\" -t"
        
        ```

        Now Open C:\xampp\sendmail\sendmail.ini. Replace all the existing code in sendmail.ini with following code
        ```sh
        [sendmail]

        smtp_server=smtp.gmail.com
        smtp_port=587
        error_logfile=error.log
        debug_logfile=debug.log
        auth_username=my-gmail-id@gmail.com
        auth_password=my-gmail-password
        force_sender=my-gmail-id@gmail.com
        ``` 

        PS: don't forgot to replace my-gmail-id and my-gmail-password in above code.
        Also remember to restart the server using the XAMMP control panel so the changes take effect.
## Tech

Task Managmant uses a number of extension:

*in php platform we use:*

* [xampp](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) - Installers and Downloads for Apache Friends!

*in web api platform we use:*
   
* from [Nuget](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.CSharp/) we use the Microsoft.AspNet.WebApi.Client

*in angular platform we use:*
    
  * [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.1.5.
        
    * [Angular MATERIAL](https://material.angular.io/) Material Design components for Angular
        

*in win form platform we use:* 

* [Telerik](https://docs.telerik.com/devtools/winforms/introduction) Performance you demand, UI you can't believe
